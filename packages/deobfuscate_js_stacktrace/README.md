# Deobfuscate JavaScript Stack Traces

This is a command-line tool written in Dart for deobfuscating JavaScript stack traces using source maps.

## Description

This tool takes a stack trace file as input and uses the corresponding source map to deobfuscate the stack trace, providing a more readable and meaningful output. The stack trace file and the corresponding source map file should be in the same directory. The source map file should have the same name as the stack trace file, but with a '.dart.js.map' extension.

## Usage

<!-- TODO:  -->

## Installation

`$ dart pub global activate -sgit https://github.com/altynbek132/flutter_util_packages.git --git-path packages/deobfuscate_js_stacktrace/`
